## 🚀 Getting Started 

### For AI Agents & Developers
1. **Read Primary Instructions**: Start with [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for complete development context
2. **Choose Implementation Area**: Review `.github/instructions/implementation/` for system-specific guidance
3. **Plan Development Work**: Use `manage_todo_list` tool for non-trivial tasks (required by BeastMode 3.1)
4. **Follow Code Placement Rules**: ALL generated code must go in `code-repository/` folder

### Critical Server Management
**🔥 ALWAYS Clean Ports First**:
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell - Clean up ports before starting
Get-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
node server-enhanced.js  # Then start server
```

### Current Development Priorities
1. **Adventure Engine Implementation** - AI-powered encounter and story generation
2. **3D Dice System** - Interactive physics-based dice rolling
3. **Epic Level Support** - Character progression to level 100
4. **Campaign Management** - Session tracking and world persistence
