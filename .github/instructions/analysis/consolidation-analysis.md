**Duplicate Content:**
- Character Manager API definitions
- Equipment system interfaces
- Adventure engine specifications
- Data validation patterns

## Consolidation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. **Merge Character Creation Documentation**
**Target File:** `.github/instructions/implementation/character-creator.instructions.md`
**Sources to Consolidate:**
- Extract unique content from `requirements/dnd-character-creator-requirements.md`
- Merge implementation details from `technical-specs/dnd-character-creator-tech-spec.md`
- Integrate enhancement specifications from `requirements/enhanced-character-creator-requirements.md`
- Archive redundant sections in `completed-work-by-agents/UPDATED-REQUIREMENTS.md`

#### 2. **Consolidate D&D 3.5 Rule Implementation**
**Target File:** `.github/instructions/implementation/srd-data-manager.instructions.md`
**Sources to Consolidate:**
- Merge complete rule specifications from `technical-specs/dnd-rules-implementation-spec.md`
- Extract validation requirements from `requirements/character-management-system-requirements.md`
- Integrate calculation formulas scattered across multiple files

#### 3. **Unify Architecture Documentation**
**Target File:** `.github/instructions/implementation/server-architecture.instructions.md`
**Sources to Consolidate:**
- Primary content from `technical-specs/server-architecture-spec.md`
- Implementation guidance from `technical-specs/complete-implementation-guide.md`
- Agent-specific instructions from `completed-work-by-agents/AI-AGENT-BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Content Preservation Strategy

#### High-Value Content to Retain
1. **Complete D&D 3.5 SRD compliance specifications**
2. **Detailed character data object structures**
3. **Production-ready implementation patterns**
4. **Testing and validation procedures**
5. **Cross-browser compatibility requirements**

#### Content to Archive/Remove
1. **Outdated implementation plans** (superseded by current .instructions.md files)
2. **Redundant requirement statements** (consolidated into primary sources)
3. **Draft documentation** (marked as obsolete)
4. **Incomplete specifications** (merged into complete versions)

## Migration Action Items

### Phase 1: Content Analysis Complete ✅
- [x] Identified all duplicate content sources
- [x] Catalogued overlapping specifications
- [x] Created consolidation plan

### Phase 2: Core Consolidation (In Progress)
- [x] Created unified .instructions.md files for major systems
- [ ] **NEXT:** Merge duplicate D&D 3.5 rule implementations
- [ ] **NEXT:** Consolidate character creation specifications
- [ ] **NEXT:** Unify architecture documentation

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Validate all consolidated content for completeness
- [ ] Verify no critical information lost in consolidation
- [ ] Test all code examples and specifications
- [ ] Update cross-references and links

### Phase 4: Archive and Cleanup
- [ ] Move redundant files to archive folder
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md to reference new structure
- [ ] Create migration guide for future developers
- [ ] Generate final project structure documentation

## Critical Information Preservation Checklist

### Must Preserve from Original Sources:
- ✅ Complete D&D 3.5 SRD compliance matrices
- ✅ Production-ready code patterns and examples
- ✅ Character data object complete specifications
- ✅ Equipment system with encumbrance calculations
- ✅ Adventure engine encounter balancing algorithms
- ✅ Browser compatibility and performance requirements
- ✅ Testing procedures and validation frameworks
- [ ] **Remaining:** Historical decision context and rationale

### Integration Verification:
- [ ] All .instructions.md files follow applyTo pattern correctly
- [ ] Code examples are consistent across all files
- [ ] No contradictory specifications between files
- [ ] Complete coverage of all major system components
- [ ] Proper cross-referencing between related systems

## Success Metrics
- **Documentation Reduction:** Target 60% reduction in duplicate content
- **Information Completeness:** 100% retention of critical specifications
- **Developer Efficiency:** Single source of truth for each system component
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Eliminate need to update same information in multiple files
- **AI Agent Effectiveness:** Clear, targeted instructions for specific development domains
