# Code Repository

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: This is the ONLY designated location for AI-generated code in this workspace.**

All coding agents and AI assistants must place generated code exclusively within this `code-repository` folder or its subfolders. No code should be generated or placed in any other location within the workspace.

## Directory Structure

```

## Code Organization Guidelines

### Source Code (`src/`)
- **Purpose**: All production code implementations
- **Structure**: Organized by feature/module/domain
- **Requirements**: Must reference originating requirement IDs in comments
- **Quality**: Must follow quality standards from `agent-instructions/quality-standards/`

### Tests (`tests/`)
- **Purpose**: All test code and test suites
- **Structure**: Mirror the `src/` structure for easy navigation
- **Coverage**: Tests must cover all generated source code
- **Traceability**: Link tests to specific requirements and user stories

### Documentation (`docs/`)
- **Purpose**: Technical documentation for generated code
- **Content**: API documentation, implementation guides, architecture diagrams
- **Maintenance**: Updated automatically when code is generated or modified

### Examples (`examples/`)
- **Purpose**: Working code examples and demonstrations
- **Usage**: Show how to use generated code and APIs
- **Testing**: Examples must be tested and validated

## AI Code Generation Rules

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

1. **Location Enforcement**: ALL generated code must be placed in `code-repository/` or its subfolders
2. **No External Code**: Do not create code files anywhere else in the workspace
3. **Folder Structure**: Follow the established directory structure
4. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive file and folder names
5. **Requirement Traceability**: Include requirement references in all generated code

### Code Placement Matrix

| Code Type | Location | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Business Logic | `src/core/` | `src/core/user_authentication.py` |
| API Endpoints | `src/services/` | `src/services/auth_service.py` |
| Utility Functions | `src/utils/` | `src/utils/validation_helpers.py` |
| Unit Tests | `tests/unit/` | `tests/unit/test_user_authentication.py` |
| Integration Tests | `tests/integration/` | `tests/integration/test_auth_flow.py` |
| API Documentation | `docs/api/` | `docs/api/authentication_api.md` |
| Code Examples | `examples/` | `examples/authentication_example.py` |

### Required Code Headers

All generated code files must include this header:

```python
"""
[Brief description of the file's purpose]

Requirements Traceability:
- REQ-XXX: [Requirement description]
- US-XXX: [User story description]
- TEST-XXX: [Related test scenario]

Generated: [Date]
Last Modified: [Date]
"""
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Before Code Generation
- [ ] Identify the correct subfolder for the code type
- [ ] Review related requirements and user stories
- [ ] Check for existing similar implementations
- [ ] Plan the file structure and naming

#### During Code Generation
- [ ] Include requirement traceability in comments
- [ ] Follow established coding standards
- [ ] Generate corresponding tests
- [ ] Create or update documentation

#### After Code Generation
- [ ] Verify code is in correct location
- [ ] Run tests to ensure functionality
- [ ] Update related documentation
- [ ] Link to originating requirements

## Integration with Requirements

### Requirement Implementation Tracking

| Requirement ID | Implementation File | Test File | Documentation | Status |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| REQ-001 | `src/auth/authentication.py` | `tests/unit/test_authentication.py` | `docs/api/auth.md` | âœ… Complete |
| REQ-002 | `src/core/user_management.py` | `tests/unit/test_user_management.py` | `docs/api/users.md` | ðŸ”„ In Progress |

### Cross-Reference System
- **From Requirements**: Reference implementation files in requirements documents
- **From Code**: Include requirement IDs in code comments and docstrings
- **From Tests**: Link test cases to specific requirements and code modules
- **From Documentation**: Connect API docs to business requirements

## Development Workflow

### 1. Requirement Analysis
- Review requirement in `requirements/` folder
- Identify implementation approach
- Plan code structure and location

### 2. Code Generation
- Generate code in appropriate `code-repository` subfolder
- Include requirement traceability
- Follow naming conventions and quality standards

### 3. Testing
- Generate corresponding tests in `tests/` folder
- Ensure test coverage meets requirements
- Validate against acceptance criteria

### 4. Documentation
- Generate or update API documentation
- Create usage examples if needed
- Update implementation tracking

### 5. Integration
- Update requirement documents with implementation references
- Link user stories to completed implementations
- Update technical specifications with actual implementation details

## Maintenance and Updates

### Version Control
- All code in this repository should be version controlled
- Use clear commit messages with requirement references
- Maintain branch structure for feature development

### Code Reviews
- All generated code should go through review process
- Validate against requirements and quality standards
- Ensure proper placement and organization

### Refactoring
- When refactoring, maintain file locations unless restructuring is necessary
- Update all references and documentation
- Preserve requirement traceability

## ðŸš¨ ENFORCEMENT NOTICE

**This code repository is the EXCLUSIVE location for all AI-generated code.**

Any code generated outside of this folder structure violates workspace organization standards and must be moved to the appropriate subfolder within `code-repository/`.

**Violations will result in:**
- Code organization issues
- Broken requirement traceability
- Failed quality assurance checks
- Difficulty in maintenance and updates

**Always verify code placement before completing any code generation task.**
