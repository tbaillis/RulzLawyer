## User Story
**As a** D&D player  
**I want** to create and customize a visual portrait of my character that automatically reflects my race, class, and equipment choices  
**So that** I have a personalized visual representation that brings my character to life and integrates seamlessly with my character sheet

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Automatic Portrait Generation
**Given** I have selected a race and gender for my character  
**When** I access the portrait designer  
**Then** the system automatically generates a base portrait with appropriate racial characteristics (skin tone, ear shape, facial structure, etc.)

### Scenario 2: Equipment Integration
**Given** I have selected class and equipment  
**When** the portrait updates  
**Then** the character automatically displays appropriate armor, weapons, and class-specific accessories without manual intervention

### Scenario 3: Manual Customization
**Given** I want to personalize my character's appearance  
**When** I use the customization tools  
**Then** I can modify facial features, hair style/color, skin tone, build, and other appearance options while maintaining racial consistency

### Scenario 4: Real-Time Synchronization
**Given** I make changes to my character's race, class, or equipment during creation  
**When** the character data is updated  
**Then** the portrait automatically refreshes to reflect these changes in real-time

### Scenario 5: Portrait Export and Integration
**Given** I have completed my character portrait  
**When** I generate my character sheet  
**Then** the high-quality portrait is automatically included and can be exported as a standalone image

portraitLayers = {
  background: { visible: true, zIndex: 1 },
  baseBody: { visible: true, zIndex: 2, raceDependent: true },
  skin: { visible: true, zIndex: 3, customizable: true },
  clothing: { visible: true, zIndex: 4, classDependent: false },
  armor: { visible: true, zIndex: 5, equipmentDependent: true },
  hair: { visible: true, zIndex: 6, customizable: true },
  facialFeatures: { visible: true, zIndex: 7, raceDependent: true },
  weapons: { visible: true, zIndex: 8, equipmentDependent: true },
  effects: { visible: true, zIndex: 9, classDependent: true }
}
```

## Notes and Comments
The portrait designer represents a significant enhancement to the character creation experience, providing visual feedback that helps players connect with their characters. The layered graphics approach ensures scalability and maintainability while the automatic synchronization reduces user effort.

Key implementation considerations:
1. **Asset Management**: Efficient loading and caching of portrait components
2. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize re-rendering and memory usage
3. **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new races, classes, and equipment
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive controls with immediate visual feedback

The system must balance automation (reflecting character choices) with customization (player preferences) while maintaining high visual quality and browser compatibility.
