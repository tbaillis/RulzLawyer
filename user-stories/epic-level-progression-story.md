## User Story
**As a** veteran D&D player with high-level characters  
**I want** to advance my character beyond level 20 using official epic level progression rules  
**So that** I can continue developing my character through epic adventures and potentially achieve divine ascension

## Detailed Description
Players who have been playing D&D characters for extended campaigns often reach level 20 and want to continue their character's growth. The Epic Level Progression system allows characters to advance from level 21 to level 100, gaining epic feats, enhanced abilities, and potentially achieving divine status. This system must handle the complex calculations and special rules that apply to epic-level characters while maintaining the core D&D 3.5 mechanics.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Epic Level Advancement
- [ ] **Given** I have a 20th level character, **When** I choose to advance to epic levels, **Then** the system switches to epic progression rules
- [ ] **Given** I am at epic levels (21+), **When** I level up, **Then** I receive epic save bonuses (+1 every even level) and epic attack bonuses (+1 every odd level)
- [ ] **Given** I advance epic levels, **When** calculating skill ranks, **Then** class skills max at character level + 3, cross-class at (character level + 3)/2

### Epic Feats System
- [ ] **Given** I reach epic levels, **When** I gain levels divisible by 3, **Then** I can choose from available epic feats or regular feats
- [ ] **Given** I select epic feats, **When** checking prerequisites, **Then** system validates epic-level requirements (ability scores 21+, high skill ranks, etc.)
- [ ] **Given** I have specific classes, **When** reaching epic levels, **Then** I receive class-specific bonus epic feats per the epic class progression

### Epic Spellcasting
- [ ] **Given** I am an epic spellcaster, **When** I level up, **Then** my caster level continues to increase but spell slots per day remain capped at 20th level
- [ ] **Given** I want more spell slots, **When** I select Improved Spell Capacity epic feat, **Then** I gain additional high-level spell slots
- [ ] **Given** I cast epic spells, **When** using spell-like abilities, **Then** calculations use my full epic caster level

### Epic Class Features
- [ ] **Given** I have class features with level-based effects, **When** at epic levels, **Then** these continue scaling with my full class level
- [ ] **Given** I have prestige classes, **When** my character level is 20+, **Then** I can advance prestige classes beyond their normal maximums
- [ ] **Given** I multiclass at epic levels, **When** calculating progression, **Then** system uses epic attack and save bonus tables

### Divine Ascension Tracking
- [ ] **Given** I meet divine ascension criteria, **When** I achieve divine status, **Then** system tracks my divine rank (0-21+)
- [ ] **Given** I have divine rank, **When** I gain divine abilities, **Then** these are displayed separately from normal class features
- [ ] **Given** I increase divine rank, **When** calculating abilities, **Then** divine bonuses apply to relevant statistics

### Performance and Calculations
- [ ] **Given** I am high epic level (50-100), **When** performing character calculations, **Then** all computations complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] **Given** complex epic character builds, **When** loading character data, **Then** system handles large data structures efficiently
- [ ] **Given** I export epic characters, **When** generating output, **Then** all epic-specific data is included accurately

## User Acceptance Tests

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Epic Advancement
```gherkin
Given I have a 20th level Human Fighter
When I advance to 21st level
Then my epic attack bonus becomes +1
And my base attack bonus remains at 20th level value
And I can select from epic feats if I qualify
And my skill point progression continues normally
```

### Test Scenario 2: Epic Feat Selection
```gherkin
Given I am a 21st level character with Strength 25
When I attempt to select "Devastating Critical" epic feat
Then the system validates my prerequisites (Str 25+, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus)
And allows me to select the feat if requirements are met
And displays the feat's epic-level effects clearly
```

### Test Scenario 3: Epic Spellcaster Progression
```gherkin
Given I am a 25th level Wizard
When I cast a 9th level spell
Then my caster level is treated as 25th for all calculations
And my spell slots per day remain at 20th level amounts
And if I have Improved Spell Capacity feat, I have additional spell slots
```

### Test Scenario 4: Divine Ascension
```gherkin
Given I am a 40th level character who has achieved divine rank 1
When I view my character sheet
Then my divine rank and associated abilities are displayed
And my divine bonuses are calculated into my statistics
And my character type shows as "Divine" instead of "Humanoid"
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Epic level progression (21-100) fully implemented with SRD-compliant rules
- [ ] Epic save and attack bonus calculations working correctly
- [ ] Epic feat system with prerequisites validation
- [ ] Epic spellcaster progression implemented
- [ ] Divine ascension tracking functional
- [ ] All epic-specific data included in character object
- [ ] Performance optimized for high-level calculations
- [ ] Unit tests covering all epic progression mechanics
- [ ] Integration tests with existing character creation system
- [ ] **ðŸš¨ All code implemented in `code-repository/` folder structure**

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Stories**: US-001 (Race Selection), US-002 (Class Selection), US-003 (Ability Scores), US-004 (Skills), US-005 (Feats), US-006 (Equipment)
- **Related Stories**: US-010 (Story Tracker) for epic-level narrative tracking
- **Technical Dependencies**: Character object structure, SRD data integration

## Technical Notes
- Epic progression requires significant calculation complexity
- Divine ascension involves fundamental character type changes
- Epic multiclassing uses different progression tables than standard rules
- Performance considerations for characters with 100+ levels of features
- Epic feat prerequisites often require specific ability score minimums and skill ranks

## Business Value
This user story enables long-term campaign play and character development beyond the standard level cap, supporting veteran players who want to continue their character's journey. Epic level play represents the pinnacle of D&D character advancement and allows for truly legendary adventures and storylines.

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex calculations cause performance issues | High | Medium | Optimize algorithms, implement caching |
| Epic rules interpretation accuracy | High | Low | Strict adherence to SRD documentation |
| Divine mechanics integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Modular design for divine abilities |
