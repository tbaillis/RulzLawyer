4. Pane animates to edge and shows pin indicator
5. System saves pinning preference

### Collapse/Expand Workflow
1. User clicks collapse button or uses context menu
2. Pane smoothly animates to collapsed state
3. Only expand icon remains visible
4. User can click icon or use context menu to expand
5. Pane animates back to full view

## Testing Scenarios

### Functional Testing
- Drag pane to all screen areas and verify constraint behavior
- Test all pin positions and verify visual indicators
- Verify context menu appears and functions correctly
- Test collapse/expand in all pin states
- Verify localStorage persistence across browser sessions

### Edge Cases
- Test behavior on very small screen sizes
- Verify pane repositioning on window resize
- Test rapid drag movements and gesture interruptions
- Verify context menu positioning near viewport edges
- Test multiple browser tabs with different pane states

### Performance Testing
- Measure drag performance with complex page layouts
- Test animation smoothness during position changes
- Verify no memory leaks from event listeners
- Test behavior with disabled JavaScript
