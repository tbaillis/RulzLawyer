## User Story
**As a** D&D player and storyteller  
**I want** to generate compelling character backstories and track ongoing narrative development throughout my adventures

## User Acceptance Tests

### Test Scenario 1: Automatic Backstory Generation
```gherkin
Given I have created a Half-Elf Ranger with high Wisdom and low Charisma
When I request automatic backstory generation
Then the system creates a narrative that explains the Ranger's connection to nature
And incorporates the character's perceptive nature (high Wisdom)
And addresses social challenges from low Charisma
And includes race-appropriate elements about dual heritage
```

### Test Scenario 2: Story Event Tracking
```gherkin
Given I am tracking my character's adventures
When I add a new story event "Defeated the Dragon of Ember Mountain"
Then I can specify the date, location, participants, and outcome
And I can attach an image of the dragon's lair
And I can tag the event with relevant keywords
And the event appears in my character's timeline
```

### Test Scenario 3: Relationship Management
```gherkin
Given I have interacted with several NPCs during adventures
When I record a relationship with "Elara the Village Elder"
Then I can specify our relationship as "Mentor"
And set trust level to 8/10
And add notes about how we met and our interactions
And view this relationship in my character's social network
```

### Test Scenario 4: Plot Hook Generation
```gherkin
Given my character has an unresolved backstory element about a missing sister
When I request plot hook suggestions
Then the system generates adventure ideas related to finding my sister
And suggests potential complications or allies in this quest
And creates hooks that can be integrated into ongoing campaigns
```

### Test Scenario 5: Guided Backstory Creation
```gherkin
Given I want to manually create my backstory with guidance
When I enter guided creation mode
Then the system prompts me for childhood experiences
And suggests options appropriate to my character's race and class
And helps me develop motivations, fears, and goals systematically
And ensures I address all important backstory components
```

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Stories**: US-008 (Character Portrait Designer) for visual integration
- **Related Stories**: US-009 (Epic Level Progression) for long-term character development
- **Technical Dependencies**: Character object structure, media asset management, template data

## Technical Notes
- Backstory generation requires extensive template databases and rule-based narrative construction
- Rich media support needs efficient image handling and storage systems
- Timeline management requires sophisticated data organization and filtering
- Relationship networks benefit from graph-based data structures
- Export functionality needs multiple format support and layout optimization
- Performance considerations for large story datasets in long campaigns

## Business Value  
This user story significantly enhances the role-playing aspect of D&D character creation and ongoing campaign play. By providing both automated and guided backstory creation tools, plus comprehensive story tracking, it supports players who want rich character narratives and DMs who need detailed character background information for campaign development. This addresses a major gap between character mechanics and character storytelling.

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Backstory generation produces inconsistent narratives | Medium | Medium | Extensive template testing and validation |
| Story data becomes too complex to manage efficiently | High | Low | Modular design with performance optimization |
| Media assets impact application performance | Medium | Medium | Lazy loading and asset optimization |
| Export functionality compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Multiple format testing across browsers |

## User Interface Considerations
- Backstory generation should integrate smoothly with character creation workflow
- Story tracking interface needs intuitive timeline and event management
- Relationship visualization requires clear, interactive network displays  
- Template selection needs organized, searchable categorization
- Export options should be accessible and clearly formatted
