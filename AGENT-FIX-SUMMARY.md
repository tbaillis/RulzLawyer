# Agent Instructions Fix Summary

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. "BeastMode 3.1" Over-Engineering
**Problem**: Instructions forced agents to "keep going until problem is solved" causing infinite loops
**Fix**: Disabled `core-principles.md.DISABLED`, created simple direct-execution rules

### 2. Mandatory Research Requirements
**Problem**: Forced web searches for every task, even simple ones
**Fix**: Made research optional, only when user requests it or for unfamiliar tech

### 3. Over-Complex Planning Requirements
**Problem**: Required todo lists and extensive planning for every task
**Fix**: Simplified planning triggers - only for 4+ step tasks or when user requests it

### 4. Conflicting Instruction Files
**Problem**: Multiple overlapping instruction files with contradictory rules
**Fix**: Disabled problematic files, created single simplified instruction set

### 5. Excessive Requirements Traceability
**Problem**: Forced documentation overhead on simple tasks
**Fix**: Simplified to basic quality standards without mandatory traceability

## New Simplified Structure

### Active Instruction Files:
- `SIMPLIFIED-COPILOT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Main simplified instructions
- `agent-instructions/SIMPLIFIED-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Backup simplified version

### Disabled Files:
- `agent-instructions/behavioral-guidelines/core-principles.md.DISABLED`
- `agent-instructions/task-specific/code-generation.md.DISABLED`

## Result
Agents should now:
1. Follow user commands directly
2. Skip unnecessary planning loops
3. Place code in `code-repository/` as required
4. Execute tasks efficiently without getting stuck in analysis loops

**Test by giving simple direct commands like "create a dice rolling function" and verify the agent executes without excessive planning or research loops.**
