## üìä Task List Best Practices

### **1. Granular Task Breakdown**
**Good Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement character creation wizard
  - [ ] Create wizard modal structure
  - [ ] Add step navigation system
  - [ ] Implement basic info step
  - [ ] Add ability score generation
  - [ ] Create race selection step
  - [ ] Build class selection step
  - [ ] Add skill allocation step
  - [ ] Implement feat selection
  - [ ] Generate final character
```

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Fix character system
- [ ] Make it work
- [ ] Test everything
```

### **2. Clear Acceptance Criteria**
**Good Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Fix storage manager getAllCharacters method
  - Must return array of character objects
  - Should handle empty storage gracefully
  - Must integrate with existing loadAllCharacters
  - Should maintain backward compatibility
```

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Fix storage stuff
```

### **3. Dependencies and Order**
**Good Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Install required dependencies (if any)
- [ ] Create core data structures
- [ ] Implement business logic (depends on data structures)
- [ ] Add user interface (depends on business logic)
- [ ] Test integration (depends on all above)
```

## üö® Common Task Management Mistakes

### **Mistake 1: Vague Tasks**
**Wrong:**
```markdown
- [ ] Make character creation work
- [ ] Fix bugs
- [ ] Improve performance
```

**Right:**
```markdown
- [ ] Fix createNewCharacter method to call wizard.startCreation()
- [ ] Add window.characterWizard global reference for navigation
- [ ] Resolve "Cannot read properties of null" error in wizard
- [ ] Test Next/Previous buttons in character wizard
```

### **Mistake 2: Not Updating Progress**
**Wrong Pattern:**
1. Create task list
2. Do all work
3. Mark everything complete at end

**Right Pattern:**
1. Create task list
2. Mark first task in-progress
3. Complete first task
4. Mark first task complete
5. Mark second task in-progress
6. Continue incrementally

### **Mistake 3: Abandoning Incomplete Tasks**
**Wrong:**
```markdown
- [x] Start character wizard fix
- [in-progress] Add global references
- [ ] Test functionality
- [ ] Validate fixes

"I'll work on this later..." [ends turn]
```

**Right:**
```markdown
- [x] Start character wizard fix
- [x] Add global references
- [x] Test functionality
- [x] Validate fixes

"All tasks completed successfully!"
```
