# Completed Work by Agents - Development History

## üìã Current Development Guide

**Primary Source**: For current development guidance, see **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)** and **[.github/instructions/](../.github/instructions/)**

This folder contains historical documentation of AI agent development work, patterns learned, and implementation history.

## üéØ Quick Navigation to Active Documentation

### AI Development Instructions
- **Current Guide**: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - Complete AI development instructions  
- **Implementation**: [.github/instructions/implementation/](../.github/instructions/implementation/) - System-specific guides
- **Development**: [.github/instructions/development/](../.github/instructions/development/) - AI agent workflows

## üéì Key Lessons Learned (from COMPLETED-WORK-LOG.md)

### Critical Error Patterns to Avoid
1. **Insufficient Context Reading**: Always read 2000+ lines before changes
2. **Class Name Assumptions**: Verify actual class names and method signatures  
3. **Missing Global References**: HTML requires `window.*` globals for onclick handlers
4. **Inadequate Testing**: Test complete workflows, not just individual components

### Successful Development Patterns
1. **Port Cleanup Protocol**: Always clean port 3000 before starting development
2. **Modular Architecture**: Dual browser/Node.js compatibility patterns
3. **Todo List Management**: Use `manage_todo_list` for complex multi-step work
4. **BeastMode 3.1**: Autonomous operation with complete problem resolution

## üöÄ Current Implementation Status

Based on historical work completed:
- ‚úÖ **Character Creator**: Enhanced Step 7 with inventory management
- ‚úÖ **Inventory System**: Drag-and-drop with 1000+ item support
- ‚úÖ **Spell Selection**: Automatic detection for spellcasting classes
- ‚è≥ **Adventure Engine**: Ready for AI-powered implementation
- ‚è≥ **3D Dice System**: Ready for physics-based implementation
- ‚è≥ **Epic Levels**: Ready for level 21-100 support

## üîÑ Migration to Modern Structure

Historical insights and patterns have been integrated into the current development structure:
- **Development Patterns**: Consolidated into [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- **Implementation Guidance**: Organized in `.github/instructions/`
- **Quality Standards**: Codified in quality-assurance.instructions.md
- **Agent Workflows**: Structured in agent-punch-lists.instructions.md

**Use AGENTS.md and .github/instructions/ for current development - reference these files for historical context and lessons learned.**
