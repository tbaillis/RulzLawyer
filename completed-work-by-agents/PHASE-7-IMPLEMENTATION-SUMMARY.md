## Integration Points

### Character Data Model Integration
Both systems integrate seamlessly with the existing character data model:

```javascript
// Character Integration Examples
character.skills.ranks[skillId] = ranks;
character.holdings.properties.push(newProperty);
character.wealth.gold -= purchaseCost;
```

### Dependency Integration
- **Skills System**: Requires CharacterDataModel and DiceEngine
- **Holdings System**: Requires CharacterDataModel for wealth/ownership tracking
- **Web Interfaces**: Use global window exports for onclick handlers
