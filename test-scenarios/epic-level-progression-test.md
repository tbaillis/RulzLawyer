## Detailed Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic Epic Level Advancement
**Objective**: Verify character can advance from level 20 to 21 with proper epic mechanics

**Setup**:

2. Ensure all non-epic progressions are at maximum (20th level caps)
3. Character has qualifying ability scores for epic feats

**Steps**:
1. Advance character from 20th to 21st level
2. Verify epic attack bonus calculation (+1 at odd levels)
3. Verify epic save bonus calculation (+0 at level 21, +1 at level 22)
4. Check skill rank maximums (character level + 3 for class skills)
5. Validate epic feat availability and prerequisites
6. Confirm base attack bonus and base saves remain at 20th level caps

**Expected Results**:
- Character level becomes 21
- Epic attack bonus: +1 applied to all attacks
- Epic save bonus: +0 (none at level 21)
- Class skill max ranks: 24 (21 + 3)
- Cross-class skill max ranks: 12 ((21 + 3)/2)
- Base attack bonus remains at 20th level value
- Base save bonuses remain at 20th level values
- **ðŸš¨ Epic calculation code executes from `code-repository/src/epic/` folder**

**Verification**:
```javascript
assert(character.level === 21);
assert(character.epicProgression.isEpic === true);
assert(character.epicProgression.epicLevel === 1);
assert(character.epicProgression.epicAttackBonus === 1);
assert(character.epicProgression.epicSaveBonus === 0);
```

3. Epic feat selection interface available

**Steps**:
1. Attempt to select "Devastating Critical" epic feat
2. Verify prerequisite checking (Str 25+, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, etc.)
3. Apply the feat and verify its effects are calculated
4. Test invalid epic feat selection (insufficient prerequisites)
5. Verify class bonus epic feats from barbarian epic progression

**Expected Results**:

2. Confirm spell slots per day remain capped at 20th level amounts
3. Apply "Improved Spell Capacity" epic feat for 10th level spells
4. Test spell DC calculations using full epic caster level
5. Validate epic spell prerequisites and casting

**Expected Results**:
- Caster level: 30 for all spell calculations

## Notes and Comments
Epic level testing requires extensive validation due to the mathematical complexity and rule interactions at high levels. Special attention must be paid to performance optimization, as calculations become exponentially more complex. Divine ascension represents a fundamental character transformation that affects every aspect of the character, requiring thorough testing of all integrated systems.

Critical testing focus areas:
1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Epic progression formulas must be exact
2. **Performance Scaling**: System must handle level 100 characters efficiently  
3. **Rule Compliance**: Strict adherence to Epic Level Handbook rules
4. **Integration Testing**: Epic systems must work with all other components
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Complex multiclass and divine interactions
