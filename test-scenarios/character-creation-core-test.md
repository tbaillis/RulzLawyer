# D&D Character Creator - Core Functionality Test

## Test Information
- **Test ID**: TEST-001
- **Test Suite**: Character Creation Core
- **Feature**: Complete Character Creation Process
- **User Story**: US-001
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Integration
- **Status**: Not Started

## Test Objective
Validate that the D&D character creation tool can successfully create a complete, valid 1st level character using the central character object architecture with all D&D 3.5 SRD rules properly implemented.

## Prerequisites
- Character creation tool loaded in browser
- All SRD data files available
- Character Manager and Rules Engine initialized
- JavaScript enabled and functioning

## Test Data
### Input Data
| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Generation Method | 4d6 Drop Lowest | Standard ability generation |
| Race | Human | Most common race for testing |
| Class | Fighter | Simple class for validation |
| Name | Test Character | For identification |

### Expected Data
Character object should contain:
- Valid ability scores (3-18 range)
- Correct racial modifiers applied
- Proper class features and progressions
- Accurate skill point calculations
- Valid feat selections

## Test Steps
### Setup
1. Open character creation tool in browser
2. Verify all JavaScript components loaded successfully
3. Clear any existing character data from local storage
4. Initialize new character creation session

### Execution
1. **Step 1**: Generate Ability Scores
   - Action: Select "4d6 Drop Lowest" method and generate scores
   - **Expected Result**: Six ability scores generated, each between 3-18, stored in character object

2. **Step 2**: Select Race
   - Action: Choose "Human" from race selection
   - **Expected Result**: Human racial features applied (bonus feat, skill points, no ability modifiers)

3. **Step 3**: Select Class  
   - Action: Choose "Fighter" class
   - **Expected Result**: Fighter class features applied (d10 HD, BAB +1, good Fort save, 2+Int skill points)

4. **Step 4**: Allocate Skill Points
   - Action: Distribute available skill points among class skills
   - **Expected Result**: Skill points allocated correctly, totals calculated with ability modifiers

5. **Step 5**: Select Feats
   - Action: Choose starting feat plus human bonus feat
   - **Expected Result**: Feats added to character with prerequisites validated

6. **Step 6**: Choose Equipment
   - Action: Select starting equipment or purchase with starting gold
   - **Expected Result**: Equipment added to character, AC and other stats updated

7. **Step 7**: Generate Character Sheet
   - Action: Display completed character sheet
   - **Expected Result**: All statistics correctly calculated and displayed

### Verification
1. Verify character object structure matches technical specification
2. Confirm all ability modifiers calculated correctly
3. Check that hit points equal Constitution modifier + class hit die
4. Validate that all racial features are present
5. Confirm skill totals include ranks + ability modifier + misc bonuses
6. Verify feat prerequisites were checked before selection

### Cleanup
1. Save character data to local storage
2. Clear test character from memory
3. Reset application state for next test

## Pass/Fail Criteria
### Pass Criteria
- Character object contains all required fields
- All ability scores within valid range (3-18)
- Racial features correctly applied
- Class features properly implemented
- Skill calculations accurate
- Feat prerequisites validated
- Character sheet displays all information correctly
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: All code located in `code-repository/` folder structure**

### Fail Criteria
- Missing or invalid character data
- Incorrect rule calculations
- Feat prerequisite violations
- Character sheet display errors
- JavaScript runtime errors
- Code placement outside `code-repository/` folder

## Error Scenarios
### Error Scenario 1: Invalid Ability Score
- **Trigger**: Manually set ability score outside 3-18 range
- **Expected Behavior**: Validation error prevents invalid assignment
- **Recovery Steps**: Display error message and revert to valid value

### Error Scenario 2: Feat Prerequisite Violation
- **Trigger**: Attempt to select feat without meeting prerequisites
- **Expected Behavior**: Feat selection blocked with explanation
- **Recovery Steps**: Show prerequisite requirements and suggest alternatives

### Error Scenario 3: Skill Point Over-Allocation
- **Trigger**: Try to spend more skill points than available
- **Expected Behavior**: Prevent over-allocation and show remaining points
- **Recovery Steps**: Adjust skill point distribution within limits

## Test Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11, macOS Ventura, Ubuntu 22.04
- **Browser**: Chrome 100+, Firefox 90+, Safari 15+, Edge 100+
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ support required
- **Storage**: Local storage available
- **Network**: Offline operation after initial load

## Dependencies
- Character Manager implementation (character-manager.js)
- Rules Engine implementation (rules-engine.js)  
- SRD data files (srd-races.js, srd-classes.js, etc.)
- UI Controller implementation (ui-controller.js)
- HTML5 and CSS3 user interface

## Automation Notes
### Automation Feasibility
High - JavaScript testing framework can automate most character creation steps and validate the character object state.

### Automation Tools
- Jest for JavaScript unit testing
- Puppeteer for browser automation
- Custom validation functions for D&D rule checking

### Automation Priority
High - Core functionality that should run with every code change

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| SRD rule implementation errors | High | Comprehensive rule validation against official sources |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Cross-browser testing in multiple environments |
| Complex feat prerequisite chains | Medium | Systematic testing of feat combinations |
| Character object corruption | High | Defensive programming and validation checks |

## Test Results
### Execution History
| Date | Tester | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| TBD | QA Engineer | Pending | Initial test execution pending development |

### Defects Found
| Defect ID | Description | Severity | Status |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| N/A | No execution yet | N/A | N/A |

## Notes and Comments
This is the primary integration test that validates the core character creation functionality. Additional specialized tests should cover edge cases, specific rule interactions, and error conditions. All testing must verify that the central character object maintains data integrity throughout the creation process.

Test execution should include validation that:
1. Character object structure matches TECH-SPEC-001 specification
2. All D&D 3.5 SRD rules are correctly implemented
3. Real-time calculations update properly
4. Export/import functionality preserves character data
5. **ðŸš¨ All implementation code resides in `code-repository/` folder structure**
