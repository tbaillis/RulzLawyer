- Character displays pointed ears characteristic of elves
- Facial structure matches elven characteristics
- Skin tone uses appropriate default for elves
- Hair style and color use elven defaults
- Body proportions reflect elven slender build
- **ðŸš¨ All portrait code executes from `code-repository/` folder**

**Verification**:
```javascript
assert(portrait.race === "Elf");
assert(portrait.base.gender === "Female");
assert(portrait.layers.facialFeatures.asset.includes("elf-ears"));
assert(portrait.customization.build === "slender");
```

### Test Case 2: Equipment Integration with Portrait

5. Verify portrait reflects equipment change

**Expected Results**:
- Chain mail appears correctly on character within 500ms
- Longsword displayed in appropriate hand/position
- Shield shown on appropriate arm
- Armor layering respects z-index ordering
- Equipment change updates portrait automatically
- No visual artifacts or layer conflicts

**Verification**:
```javascript
assert(portrait.equipment.armor === "chain-mail");
assert(portrait.equipment.weapons.includes("longsword"));
assert(portrait.equipment.shield === "shield-medium");
assert(portrait.layers.armor.visible === true);
assert(portrait.layers.weapons.visible === true);
```

### Test Case 3: Manual Customization System
**Objective**: Validate manual customization tools work correctly

**Setup**:

2. Modify hair style from "short" to "long"  
3. Change hair color to red
4. Add facial hair (full beard)
5. Adjust build from "average" to "stocky"
6. Save customizations

**Expected Results**:
- Each customization applied immediately (< 500ms)
- All changes persist in character object
- Portrait maintains visual coherence
- Customization history tracked for undo/redo
- Changes integrate seamlessly with racial characteristics

**Verification**:
```javascript
assert(portrait.customization.skinTone === "#8B6914");
assert(portrait.customization.hairStyle === "long");
assert(portrait.customization.hairColor === "#FF4500");
assert(portrait.customization.facialHair === "full");
assert(portrait.customization.build === "stocky");
```

### Test Case 4: Real-Time Character Integration

## Notes and Comments
The portrait generation system represents a significant technical and user experience enhancement. Testing must verify both the technical implementation (layered graphics, performance) and user experience (intuitive customization, visual quality).

Critical testing areas:
1. **Asset Management**: Efficient loading and rendering of graphics
2. **Integration Quality**: Seamless connection with character data
3. **Performance**: Responsive updates under all conditions
4. **Visual Quality**: Professional appearance across all combinations
5. **Cross-Browser Consistency**: Identical experience everywhere

The test scenarios ensure the portrait system enhances rather than complicates the character creation process while maintaining high technical standards.
