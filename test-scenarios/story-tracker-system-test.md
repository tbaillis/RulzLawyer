## Timeline and Event Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Campaign Story Arc Tracking
```gherkin
Given I have a character in an ongoing campaign
When I create a new story arc "The Cult Investigation"  
Then I can organize related events into chapters
And I can track participant NPCs across multiple sessions
And I can visualize story progression over time
And I can generate arc summaries for reference
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Character Relationship Web
```gherkin
Given I have multiple party members in the same campaign
When I map relationships between characters and NPCs
Then the system shows interconnected relationship networks
And I can identify potential conflicts or alliances
And I can track group dynamics over time
And I can generate party relationship reports
```

## Notes and Comments
Story tracking and backstory generation represent a significant enhancement to the character creation experience, transforming mechanical character building into rich narrative development. Testing must validate both the technical functionality and the creative quality of generated content.

Critical testing focus areas:
1. **Narrative Quality**: Generated backstories must be engaging and character-appropriate
2. **Data Organization**: Complex story data must remain manageable and searchable
3. **Performance Scaling**: System must handle extensive campaign histories efficiently
4. **Media Integration**: Rich media must enhance rather than complicate the experience
5. **User Experience**: Story tools must be intuitive and enhance rather than interrupt gameplay

The story system bridges the gap between character mechanics and roleplay, requiring careful attention to both technical accuracy and creative quality.
