# Requirements Analysis Framework

## Overview
This document provides a framework for analyzing and prioritizing requirements for coding agent development projects.

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Functional Requirements Analysis
- **Core Features**: Essential functionality that must be present
- **Enhanced Features**: Valuable additions that improve user experience
- **Future Features**: Potential future enhancements for later versions

### 2. Technical Feasibility Analysis
- **High Feasibility**: Can be implemented with current technology and resources
- **Medium Feasibility**: Requires additional research or resources
- **Low Feasibility**: Significant technical challenges or resource constraints

### 3. Business Impact Analysis
- **High Impact**: Directly affects core business objectives or user satisfaction
- **Medium Impact**: Provides meaningful value but not critical to core objectives
- **Low Impact**: Nice-to-have features with minimal business impact

### 4. Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Complexity, dependencies, technical unknowns
- **Schedule Risk**: Impact on project timeline
- **Resource Risk**: Availability of required skills/tools
- **Business Risk**: Market changes, competitive factors

## Prioritization Matrix

| Requirement | Business Impact | Technical Feasibility | Risk Level | Priority |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|------------|----------|
| REQ-001     | High           | High                 | Low        | P1       |
| REQ-002     | Medium         | High                 | Medium     | P2       |
| REQ-003     | High           | Low                  | High       | P3       |

## Priority Levels
- **P1 (Critical)**: Must have for initial release
- **P2 (High)**: Should have for initial release
- **P3 (Medium)**: Could have for initial release
- **P4 (Low)**: Won't have for initial release but consider for future

## Gap Analysis Template

### Current State
[Description of current capabilities]

### Desired State
[Description of target capabilities]

### Gaps Identified
1. **Gap 1**: [Description of gap]
   - **Impact**: [How this gap affects users/business]
   - **Solution**: [Proposed solution approach]
   - **Effort**: [Estimated effort to address]

2. **Gap 2**: [Description of gap]
   - **Impact**: [How this gap affects users/business]
   - **Solution**: [Proposed solution approach]
   - **Effort**: [Estimated effort to address]
