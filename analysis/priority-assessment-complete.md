- **Full Modern Experience**: 117 story points (71 weeks) for industry-leading system
- **Highest Impact**: Character Portrait Designer provides immediate user value
- **Biggest Challenge**: Story Tracker system due to complexity and scope

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Phase 1 Focus**: Complete critical missing features for functional completeness
2. **Iterative Development**: Release features as completed for user feedback
3. **Community Involvement**: Leverage D&D community for testing and validation  
4. **Performance Priority**: Maintain gaming-quality performance throughout development

The proposed development plan transforms the D&D Character Creator from a functional tool into a modern gaming application that can compete with commercial RPG software while maintaining its open-source accessibility and community focus.

**Success depends on**: Adequate development resources, community engagement, and disciplined execution of the phased development plan with realistic timeline expectations.
