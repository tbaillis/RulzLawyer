import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from code_repository.src.[module].[filename] import ClassName

class TestClassName(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Unit tests for ClassName functionality.
    
    Tests validate requirements:
    - REQ-XXX: Primary requirement being tested
    - US-XXX: User story acceptance criteria
    """
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.instance = ClassName()
    
    def test_method_name_success(self):
        """Test successful execution of method_name."""
        # Arrange
        expected_result = "expected_value"
        
        # Act
        result = self.instance.method_name("input")
        
        # Assert
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)
    
    def test_method_name_error_handling(self):
        """Test error handling in method_name."""
        # Test error scenarios from requirements
        with self.assertRaises(SpecificException):
            self.instance.method_name(invalid_input)
```
