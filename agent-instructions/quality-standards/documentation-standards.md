- [ ] Examples are provided where helpful
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly stated
- [ ] Scope boundaries are clear

#### Consistency
- [ ] Formatting follows established templates
- [ ] Naming conventions are followed throughout
- [ ] Cross-references use standard format
- [ ] Priority levels align with framework
- [ ] Version control is maintained

#### Traceability
- [ ] Requirements link to user stories
- [ ] User stories reference test scenarios
- [ ] Technical specs align with requirements
- [ ] Change history is documented
- [ ] Approval trail is maintained

### Code Quality Standards

#### Code Structure
- [ ] Functions have single responsibility
- [ ] Classes are cohesive and loosely coupled
- [ ] Code follows established design patterns
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed

#### Documentation
- [ ] All public interfaces are documented
- [ ] Complex business logic is explained
- [ ] Requirements references are included
- [ ] Usage examples are provided
- [ ] Change history is maintained

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests cover all major functions
- [ ] Integration tests verify requirements
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Error conditions are validated
- [ ] Performance tests exist for critical paths

## Review Checklist

### Pre-Review Preparation
Before submitting any document for review:

1. **Template Compliance**
   - Verify all required sections are complete
   - Check formatting consistency
   - Validate cross-references and links
   - Ensure proper version numbering

2. **Content Quality**
   - Review for clarity and precision
   - Verify technical accuracy
   - Check business alignment
   - Validate feasibility assessments

3. **Traceability**
   - Confirm all references are valid
   - Verify bidirectional linking
   - Check dependency mapping
   - Validate requirement coverage

### Review Process

#### Stakeholder Review
- [ ] Business stakeholders review business requirements
- [ ] Technical stakeholders review technical specifications
- [ ] QA stakeholders review test scenarios
- [ ] Users review user stories and acceptance criteria

#### Approval Criteria
Documents are approved when:
- [ ] All review comments are addressed
- [ ] Quality standards are met
- [ ] Stakeholders have signed off
- [ ] Traceability is verified
- [ ] Risk assessment is complete

## Metrics and Measurement

### Quality Metrics
Track these metrics to ensure quality improvement:

#### Documentation Metrics
- **Completeness**: Percentage of template sections completed
- **Consistency**: Adherence to naming and formatting standards
- **Traceability**: Percentage of requirements with valid links
- **Review Cycle Time**: Time from submission to approval

#### Implementation Metrics
- **Requirements Coverage**: Percentage of requirements implemented
- **Defect Rate**: Issues found during implementation
- **Change Request Rate**: Requirements modifications needed
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Stakeholder feedback scores

### Continuous Improvement

#### Regular Assessment
- Monthly quality reviews of documentation
- Quarterly analysis of implementation success
- Annual review of standards and templates
- Ongoing feedback collection from stakeholders

#### Improvement Actions
Based on metrics and feedback:
- Update templates to address common issues
- Enhance training for requirements authors
- Improve review processes and checklists
- Refine quality standards and criteria

## Tools and Automation

### Quality Checks
Automated quality checks should verify:
- Template compliance and completeness
- Cross-reference validity and consistency
- Naming convention adherence
- Version control and change tracking

### Integration Points
Quality standards integrate with:
- Version control systems for change tracking
- Review tools for stakeholder feedback
- Project management for requirement tracking
- Testing tools for validation coverage

## Exception Handling

### Quality Exceptions
When quality standards cannot be met:

1. **Document the Exception**
   - Reason for deviation from standards
   - Impact assessment and mitigation
   - Approval from appropriate stakeholder
   - Timeline for remediation if applicable

2. **Track and Monitor**
   - Maintain exception log and status
   - Regular review of outstanding exceptions
   - Analysis of exception patterns and trends
   - Process improvement based on learnings

### Emergency Procedures
For urgent requirements that bypass normal quality processes:
- Fast-track review process with essential checks only
- Mandatory post-implementation quality review
- Documentation of lessons learned
- Process improvement recommendations
