# AGENTS.md - Development Instructions

## Project Overview

RulzLawyer is a comprehensive D&D 3.5 Character Creator and Adventure Engine that requires full development and implementation by AI coding agents.

**Project Goal**: Build a world-class D&D 3.5 gaming system with character creation and AI-powered adventure engine

**Current Status**: Planning and documentation phase complete - ready for implementation

## üéØ **Implementation Requirements**

**üìã Primary Implementation Guide**: See [`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for complete technical guidance and architectural patterns.

**What Must Be Built**:
- ‚è≥ Complete D&D 3.5 character creation system (7-step wizard)
- ‚è≥ Advanced inventory management with drag-and-drop interface  
- ‚è≥ Spell selection system for spellcasting classes
- ‚è≥ Equipment preset system (Combat/Exploration/Social/Survival)
- ‚è≥ Adventure engine with encounter generation
- ‚è≥ Dice rolling system with D&D 3.5 mechanics
- ‚è≥ Character persistence and storage system

**Development Specifications**:
- **Architecture**: Node.js backend with JavaScript frontend, modular design
- **Compliance**: Strict adherence to D&D 3.5 SRD rules and calculations
- **User Experience**: Award-winning UI/UX with accessibility compliance
- **Quality Standards**: Comprehensive testing and error-free execution

## üö® CRITICAL CODE PLACEMENT RULES

**ALL generated code MUST be placed exclusively in `code-repository/` folder or its subfolders**
- Reference the `code-repository/README.md` for code organization guidelines
- Never place code in root directory or other folders
- Maintain the established module structure in `code-repository/src/`

## üéØ Mandatory Agent Protocols

### BeastMode 3.1 - Autonomous Operation
- **Complete Problem Resolution**: You MUST iterate and keep going until the problem is solved
- **Mandatory Planning**: Use `manage_todo_list` tool for ALL non-trivial work
- **Extensive Research**: Use `fetch_webpage` tool to verify current package information
- **Perfect Solutions**: Test rigorously and handle all edge cases
- **No Premature Termination**: Do not end your turn until the problem is completely solved

### Required Todo List Usage
```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: Description of the first step
- [x] Step 2: Completed step description  
- [ ] Step 3: Description of the next step
```

## üöÄ Development Requirements

### Server Management Rules
**ALWAYS Clean Up Ports Before Starting Server**: Before running `node server.js`, ALWAYS check for and kill any processes using port 3000 to prevent "address already in use" errors

#### Port Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell - Clean up ports before starting
Get-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Then start server
node server-enhanced.js
```

**Startup Sequence**: 1) Clean ports, 2) Start server, 3) Verify functionality

### Core Application Commands
```bash
# Start the enhanced HTTP server
node server-enhanced.js

# Run comprehensive system validation
node -e "console.log('Testing all systems...'); /* validation script */"

# Test individual components
cd code-repository && node -e "const DiceEngine = require('./src/dice-engine.js'); console.log('DiceEngine loaded');"
```

## System Architecture

### Core Modules (All in code-repository/src/)
1. **DiceEngine** - Advanced D&D 3.5 dice mechanics
2. **RandomTablesEngine** - All D&D 3.5 random tables (17+ tables)
3. **CharacterManager** - Complete character creation and management
4. **AdventureEngine** - Full adventure and encounter generation
5. **WebInterface** - HTML integration and user interface
6. **StorageManager** - Character persistence and data management

### Critical Integration Points
- **HTML to JavaScript**: Requires `window.*` globals for onclick handlers
- **Module Loading Order**: DiceEngine ‚Üí RandomTablesEngine ‚Üí CharacterManager ‚Üí AdventureEngine
- **Browser vs Node.js**: Use conditional exports for dual environment support

## Testing Instructions

### System Validation Protocol
1. **Port Cleanup**: Always clean port 3000 first
2. **Server Start**: Launch enhanced server on localhost:3000
3. **Module Testing**: Test each core module individually
4. **Integration Testing**: Test complete character creation workflow
5. **End-to-End Testing**: Test full user experience

### Required Test Coverage
- Character creation wizard (7-step D&D 3.5 process)
- Dice rolling system (advantage/disadvantage, complex expressions)
- Random table generation (all 17+ D&D tables)
- Adventure engine (balanced encounters for party levels)
- Storage system (character save/load/persistence)

## Code Style and Conventions

### JavaScript Standards
- ES6+ modern JavaScript syntax
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Browser/Node.js dual compatibility patterns

### D&D 3.5 Compliance
- Strict adherence to D&D 3.5 SRD rules
- Accurate stat calculations and progression
- Proper spell, feat, and skill implementations
- Balanced encounter generation

### Documentation Standards
- Inline comments explaining business logic
- README files for each major module
- Change logs for significant updates
- API documentation for public methods

## Critical Error Patterns to Avoid

### From Debugging Session Analysis:
1. **Insufficient Context Reading**: Always read 2000+ lines of context before changes
2. **Class Name Assumptions**: Verify actual class names (e.g., `RandomTablesEngine` not `RandomTablesIndex`)
3. **Method Name Guessing**: Check actual method signatures (e.g., `startCreation()` not `startWizard()`)
4. **Missing Global References**: HTML requires `window.characterWizard` for onclick handlers
5. **Inadequate Testing**: Test complete workflows, not just individual components

### Browser Integration Requirements
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Global references for HTML integration
window.characterWizard = wizard;  // For HTML onclick handlers
window.diceEngine = diceEngine;   // For HTML dice rolling
window.gameActions = gameActions; // For HTML game interactions
```

## Security Considerations

- Never execute untrusted code without validation
- Validate all user inputs in character creation
- Sanitize data before storage operations
- Use secure random number generation for dice rolling
- Protect against XSS in HTML generation

## Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment Checklist**:
   - All ports cleaned and available
   - All modules tested and functional
   - No console errors in browser
   - Complete user workflows validated

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Use enhanced server (`server-enhanced.js`)
   - Verify all static assets load correctly
   - Test character creation end-to-end
   - Validate adventure generation works
   - Confirm data persistence functions
