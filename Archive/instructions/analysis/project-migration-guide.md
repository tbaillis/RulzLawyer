# Project Restructure Migration Guide

## 📁 New VSCode AI-Optimized Structure

### Primary Documentation Structure
The RulzLawyer project has been reorganized following Microsoft's VSCode AI development best practices with targeted `.instructions.md` files using `applyTo` frontmatter for precise AI guidance.

### ApplyTo Targeting System
Each `.instructions.md` file uses Microsoft's `applyTo` frontmatter pattern for precise targeting:

```yaml
---
description: "Brief description of the instruction content"
applyTo: "**/pattern/**,**/another-pattern/**"
---
```

**Targeting Examples:**
- `character-creator.instructions.md` → `"**/character/**,**/wizard/**,**/creation/**"`
- `inventory-management.instructions.md` → `"**/inventory/**,**/equipment/**,**/ui/**"`
- `srd-data-manager.instructions.md` → `"**/srd/**,**/rules/**,**/data/**"`

## 📚 Usage Guidelines for New Structure

### For AI Agents Working on RulzLawyer:

#### 1. **Start with AGENTS.md**
- Read complete project overview and requirements
- Understand BeastMode 3.1 autonomous operation protocols
- Review mandatory todo list usage and planning requirements

#### 2. **Select Relevant Instructions**
- Choose appropriate `.instructions.md` file based on your assignment
- Character creation work → `character-creator.instructions.md`
- D&D rule implementation → `srd-data-manager.instructions.md`
- UI/inventory features → `inventory-management.instructions.md`

#### 3. **Follow Implementation Patterns**
- All code must support dual Node.js/browser environments
- Use established module export patterns
- Follow D&D 3.5 SRD compliance requirements exactly
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation

#### 4. **Use Punch Lists for Task Management**
- Reference `agent-punch-lists.instructions.md` for specific implementation tasks
- Each task has defined deliverables, acceptance criteria, and testing requirements
- Use `manage_todo_list` tool for multi-step work as required by BeastMode 3.1

### For Human Developers:

#### 1. **Environment Setup**
- Follow `developer-punch-lists.instructions.md` for complete setup procedures
- Pay special attention to port management (always clean port 3000 first)
- Verify dual-environment compatibility for all modules

#### 2. **Implementation Order**
1. **Phase 1:** SRD Data Manager (foundation for all D&D calculations)
2. **Phase 2:** Character Creation Wizard (core user workflow)  
3. **Phase 3:** Inventory Management (equipment and encumbrance)
4. **Phase 4:** Adventure Engine (encounter generation and balance)

#### 3. **Quality Assurance**
- Use `quality-assurance.instructions.md` for code review standards
- All D&D calculations must be validated against SRD
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage with comprehensive unit tests
- Verify cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness

### For Project Maintainers:

#### 1. **Adding New Features**
- Create new `.instructions.md` files following established patterns
- Use appropriate `applyTo` targeting for AI agent precision
- Maintain separation between implementation guides and development workflow

#### 2. **Updating Existing Instructions**
- Update single source of truth files rather than creating duplicates
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing implementation patterns
- Document breaking changes and provide migration guidance

#### 3. **Managing Dependencies**
- Keep task dependencies explicit in punch lists
- Update integration points when modifying system interfaces
- Maintain performance benchmarks and testing requirements

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Follow Guidelines:
1. **D&D 3.5 SRD Compliance:** Every calculation must match official rules exactly
2. **Dual Environment Support:** All modules must work in both Node.js and browser
3. **Performance Standards:** Meet specified benchmarks for all operations
4. **Error-Free Execution:** Comprehensive error handling for production quality
5. **Documentation Maintenance:** Keep instruction files current with code changes

### Avoid Common Pitfalls:
1. **Don't Create New Requirement Files:** Use existing `.instructions.md` files
2. **Don't Duplicate Content:** Reference existing instructions rather than copying
3. **Don't Skip Testing:** Every implementation must include comprehensive tests
4. **Don't Ignore Port Cleanup:** Always clean port 3000 before starting development
5. **Don't Assume Browser Compatibility:** Test in all required browsers
