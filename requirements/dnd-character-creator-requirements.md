## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use only JavaScript (no Python allowed)
- Must work in modern web browsers without server backend
- Must maintain all data in single JavaScript object structure
- No external JavaScript frameworks or libraries
- Portrait generation must use SVG or Canvas-based layered graphics
- All portrait assets must be embedded or loadable as data URLs
