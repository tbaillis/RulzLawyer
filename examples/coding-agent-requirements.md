## Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for a coding agent capable of generating, reviewing, and refactoring code across multiple programming languages. The agent should assist developers by automating routine coding tasks while maintaining code quality and best practices.

## Scope and Objectives
### In Scope
- Code generation from natural language descriptions
- Code review and quality assessment
- Code refactoring suggestions
- Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, Java, C#)
- Integration with popular IDEs
- Context-aware suggestions based on existing codebase

### Out of Scope
- Direct deployment to production environments
- Database administration tasks
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Real-time collaboration features

### Success Criteria
- Generate syntactically correct code 95% of the time
- Reduce development time by 30% for routine tasks
- Maintain code quality scores above 8/10
- Support for at least 4 major programming languages

## Functional Requirements

- **Source**: Developer interviews and surveys
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Accept natural language input describing desired functionality
  - Generate syntactically correct code in the requested language
  - Include appropriate comments and documentation
  - Handle common programming patterns and structures
- **Dependencies**: Natural language processing capabilities

### Requirement ID: FR-002
- **Description**: The agent must perform automated code reviews
- **Priority**: High
- **Source**: Quality assurance requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Analyze code for syntax errors
  - Check adherence to coding standards
  - Identify potential security vulnerabilities
  - Suggest performance improvements
  - Generate review reports with actionable feedback
- **Dependencies**: Code analysis engine, coding standards database

### Requirement ID: FR-003
- **Description**: The agent must suggest code refactoring opportunities
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Source**: Technical debt reduction initiative
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - Identify code duplication
  - Suggest more efficient algorithms
  - Recommend design pattern improvements
  - Provide before/after comparisons
- **Dependencies**: Pattern recognition system, performance benchmarking

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Generate code snippets within 5 seconds
- **Throughput**: Handle 100 concurrent requests
- **Scalability**: Scale to support 1000+ developers

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Support enterprise SSO systems
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt code and conversations at rest and in transit

### Usability Requirements
- **User Experience**: Intuitive chat-based interface
- **Accessibility**: Support screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Constraints and Assumptions
### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing development tools
- Limited to publicly available code patterns for training
- Must operate within corporate network restrictions

### Business Constraints
- Development budget of $500,000
- Must be delivered within 12 months
- Must comply with enterprise security policies

### Assumptions
- Developers have basic understanding of AI-assisted development
- Corporate network allows external API access for updates
- Existing code repositories can be analyzed for context
