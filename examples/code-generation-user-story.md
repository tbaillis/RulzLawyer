# Example: Code Generation User Story

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-0001
- **Epic**: Code Generation
- **Theme**: Developer Productivity
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Status**: Backlog

## User Story
**As a** software developer  
**I want** to describe a function in natural language  
**So that** the agent can generate the corresponding code automatically

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Simple Function Generation
**Given** I have opened the coding agent interface  
**When** I type "Create a function that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order"  
**Then** the agent generates a properly formatted sorting function with appropriate comments

### Scenario 2: Error Handling
**Given** I provide an ambiguous or incomplete description  
**When** the agent cannot generate code with confidence  
**Then** the agent asks clarifying questions before generating code

### Scenario 3: Language Selection
**Given** I specify a programming language in my request  
**When** I ask for code generation  
**Then** the agent generates code in the specified language following that language's conventions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Agent can parse natural language descriptions
- [ ] Code generation works for at least 3 programming languages
- [ ] Generated code includes appropriate comments
- [ ] Error handling for ambiguous requests is implemented
- [ ] Unit tests cover core functionality
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Business Value
Reduces time spent on routine coding tasks by 50%, allowing developers to focus on complex problem-solving and architecture decisions.

## Dependencies
- Natural language processing engine
- Code template library
- Language-specific formatting rules

## Technical Notes
- Consider using transformer-based models for better context understanding
- Implement feedback loop to improve generation quality over time
- Cache common patterns for faster response times
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: All generated code must be placed in `code-repository/` folder structure**
- Follow the code organization guidelines in `code-repository/README.md`

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1: Basic Function Generation
- **Preconditions**: Agent is running and accessible via chat interface
- **Steps**: 
  1. Open agent chat interface
  2. Type: "Create a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number"
  3. Submit the request
- **Expected Result**: Agent generates a factorial function with proper Python syntax, docstring, and error handling in the `code-repository/src/` folder

### Test Case 2: Complex Data Structure
- **Preconditions**: Agent is running and has access to language libraries
- **Steps**: 
  1. Request: "Create a JavaScript class for managing a shopping cart with add, remove, and total methods"
  2. Specify that it should handle discount codes
  3. Submit the request
- **Expected Result**: Agent generates a complete class with all requested methods and discount functionality in the `code-repository/src/` folder

## Notes and Comments
Consider integrating with IDE extensions for seamless workflow integration. May need to handle edge cases like deprecated language features or security-sensitive operations.
