# Example: Code Generation Test Scenario

## Test Information
- **Test ID**: TEST-0001
- **Test Suite**: Code Generation Validation
- **Feature**: Natural Language to Code Generation
- **User Story**: US-0001
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Integration
- **Status**: Not Started

## Test Objective
Validate that the coding agent can successfully generate syntactically correct and functionally accurate code from natural language descriptions across multiple programming languages.

## Prerequisites
- Coding agent service is running and accessible
- Test environment has Python, JavaScript, and Java runtime environments
- Agent has been trained on current language standards
- Test user has appropriate permissions to access the agent

## Test Data
### Input Data
| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Language | Python | Primary test language |
| Description | "Create a function that finds the maximum value in a list" | Simple, clear request |
| Expected Function Name | find_maximum | Should follow Python naming conventions |

### Expected Data
The generated code should include:
- Proper function definition with descriptive name
- Parameter validation
- Error handling for empty lists
- Docstring with usage example
- Return statement with correct value

## Test Steps
### Setup
1. Start the coding agent service
2. Open the agent chat interface
3. Verify agent is responding to health checks
4. Clear any previous conversation history

### Execution
1. **Step 1**: Submit natural language request
   - Action: Type "Create a Python function that finds the maximum value in a list of numbers"
   - **Expected Result**: Agent acknowledges request and begins processing
   
2. **Step 2**: Review generated code
   - Action: Examine the generated code response
   - **Expected Result**: Code contains proper Python syntax, function definition, and logic
   
3. **Step 3**: Test code execution
   - Action: Copy generated code to Python interpreter and test with sample data
   - **Expected Result**: Code executes without errors and returns correct results

### Verification
1. Verify code syntax is valid Python
2. Verify function handles edge cases (empty list, single item, negative numbers)
3. Verify code includes appropriate documentation
4. Verify code follows Python naming conventions and PEP 8 standards

### Cleanup
1. Clear test data from interpreter
2. Reset agent conversation state
3. Log test results in test management system

## Pass/Fail Criteria
### Pass Criteria
- Generated code is syntactically correct
- Code functionality matches the request
- Code includes proper error handling
- Code follows language best practices
- Response time is under 10 seconds

### Fail Criteria
- Syntax errors in generated code
- Incorrect functionality or logic
- Missing error handling for edge cases
- Response time exceeds 30 seconds
- Agent fails to understand the request

## Error Scenarios
### Error Scenario 1: Ambiguous Request
- **Trigger**: Submit vague request like "make a function"
- **Expected Behavior**: Agent asks clarifying questions
- **Recovery Steps**: Provide more specific requirements

### Error Scenario 2: Unsupported Language
- **Trigger**: Request code in unsupported language
- **Expected Behavior**: Agent explains language limitations
- **Recovery Steps**: Request code in supported language

## Test Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11, macOS, Ubuntu 20.04
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for agent API calls
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for web interface

## Dependencies
- Agent training must be completed
- Code execution environments must be available
- Test data sets must be prepared
- Network connectivity to agent service

## Automation Notes
### Automation Feasibility
This test can be partially automated. Code generation and syntax validation can be automated, but semantic correctness may require human review.

### Automation Tools
- Selenium for web interface testing
- Python unittest framework for code validation
- Custom scripts for syntax checking

### Automation Priority
High - This is a core functionality test that should run with every build

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Agent service unavailable | High | Implement service health checks and fallback options |
| Generated code has security vulnerabilities | Medium | Include security scanning in test validation |
| Performance degradation under load | Medium | Include load testing scenarios |

## Test Results
### Execution History
| Date | Tester | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| TBD | Test Engineer | Pending | Initial test execution |

### Defects Found
| Defect ID | Description | Severity | Status |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| N/A | No defects found yet | N/A | N/A |

## Notes and Comments
This test case focuses on basic functionality. Additional test cases should cover complex scenarios, multiple languages, and performance under various loads. Consider adding tests for code quality metrics and adherence to coding standards.
